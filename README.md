## Getting Started

###Are there any potential issues for scaling the prototype beyond a subset of users? Examples: reliance on a single server to handle the demand, coded for a specific platform

No, There are none issue with the scaling. Currently we have deployed it on 000webhost's free service. We are ready for scaling the prototype to the paid version which is having more relaible servers and Database capacity including daily  backups and extended security.


###If the data is sensitive, is it stored in the proper locations?

Yes, those credentials are not shared in the repository.


###Does the app collect analytics on user behaviour to help improve the UX?

No, right now we are not having that feature, but we are definitely looking forward to meet that expectation in our next enhancement. Feedbacks are always welcomed by our group.


###Deployed to a URL if a web app, or test devices provided if it is a platform-specific app? Note: the whole app needs to be deployed not only the landing page/s

Yes, we have included our entire prototype in the single website link given above as Live URL.


###Does something interesting – for ex., mockup available, machine learning, data aggregation/visualization, IR techniques (anything you think may qualify as an extra feature)

We are having awesome feature of price comparison which people will definitely love as that  will save their money.
Also, the blog feature is there to post something amazing for food or restaurant in the market.


Our full application is deployed and tested well. However, feedback is always appreciated.
